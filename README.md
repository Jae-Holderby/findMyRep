# Find My Reps

Find My Reps is a webpage that shows you who your representatives are based on your state and address. It uses Google's Civic API to find your district number, and then uses ProPublica's API to gather info on your representatives and displays it in the window.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repository to get the code for this project and open up the index.html, app.js, and base.css files. I used the Boostrap v4 css framework for the page layout. There is no need to download it as the CDN is in the html file

### Prerequisites

For the styling I used Sass. If you are on a mac install sass by copy and pasting in your terminal

 <gem install sass>

if it does not install use

 <sudo gem install sass>

 to check if it is installed type

 <sass - v>

Sass runs on Ruby so if you are on windows you need to install Ruby first.
